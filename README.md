# Unit 14 Tech Blog

## Description of Assignment

I created a CMS-style blog site similar to a Wordpress site, where developers can publish their blog posts and comment on other developersâ€™ posts as well. This app follows the MVC paradigm and uses using Handlebars.js as the templating language, Sequelize as the ORM, and the express-session npm package for authentication.

## User Story

```md
AS A developer who writes about tech
I WANT a CMS-style blog site
SO THAT I can publish articles, blog posts, and my thoughts and opinions
```

## Mock-Up
